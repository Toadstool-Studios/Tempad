The Time Variance Authority is an organization charged with keeping watch over all timelines in the multiverse. It is likely that
whoever is reading this text is being and has always been monitored by the TVA.

This handbook is a guide to the TVA's various technologies and tools, explaining how they work and how to use them.

Travel Advisory for Agents going to Sector MC-1:

While the technology developed by the TVA is the most advanced in the multiverse, it is not capable of the impossible. Just
as Time doors cannot be opened to different points of time within the TVA, they cannot be opened to different points of time
in Sector MC-1. Much like the TVA, Time passes differently in Sector MC-1, and as such, the TVA's technology is not capable of
moving through time in this sector
